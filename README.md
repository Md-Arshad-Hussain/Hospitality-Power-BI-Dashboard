# Hospitality-Power-BI-Dashboard
## Problem Statements
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hore a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Key Insights
Here’s a **combined Key Insights** summary based on both dashboards you've shared, suitable for including in your **GitHub README** or documentation. It integrates operational performance, guest behavior, and revenue analysis into one concise section:
