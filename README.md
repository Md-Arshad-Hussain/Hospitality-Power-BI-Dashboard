## Problem Statements
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

###  Key Insights

🔸 **Revenue Leaders**: Mumbai is the top revenue-generating city (₹668M), while properties like *Atliq Exotica* and *Atliq Palace (Mumbai)* stand out as the highest individual contributors.

🔸 **Occupancy vs. Ratings**: Delhi leads in occupancy (60.5%), but not in ratings—indicating demand is strong despite room for service improvement. Atliq Blu holds the highest rating (4.32), far above Atliq Seasons (2.29).

🔸 **Booking Platforms**: Majority of bookings come from "Others" (41%) and MakeMyTrip (20%), suggesting a need to understand and capitalize on these indirect channels.

🔸 **Day Type Impact**: Weekends outperform weekdays in both **RevPAR** (₹7,927 vs ₹7,101) and **occupancy** (62.08% vs 56.0%) — suggesting pricing strategies can be optimized for weekends.

🔸 **Performance Trends**: RevPAR and Realisation% are improving steadily, but a dip in revenue (\~28.17%) is observed during the **last 4 days of the month**, highlighting a potential optimization opportunity.

🔸 **Booking Cancellations**: Cancellation rates are highest in June (25.09%) — focus on tightening cancellation policies and improving guest experience during this period.

🔸 **Category Mix**: **Business category** drives over 61% of total revenue — suggesting corporate bookings are a significant source of income.

🔸 **Realisation% & ADR by Platform**: Platforms like **Direct Online** and **Others** show strong realisation% % paired with higher ADRs — good targets for boosting premium sales.

🔸 **Platform Performance Consistency**: While some platforms like Logtrip and Tripster have lower volumes, their ADR and realisation % remain competitive — they shouldn’t be ignored in growth strategies.
